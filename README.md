# Four In A Row

Four in a Row is a replica of Connect Four.

## Description

The object of this game is for the one of two players to connect four tokens in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
Players take turns dropping tokens from the top of the board. A token will land on the lowest available space. For example,
if Player 1 drops a token in the first column, and Player 2 drops a token in the first column after Player 1, then Player 2's
token will land on top of Player 1's token.

If a column is filled to the last available space, then no other tokens may be dropped into that column. 

## Implementation

Four in a Row is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is an Object-Oriented approach to the creation of the game.
